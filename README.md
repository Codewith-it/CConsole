# CConsole
A Javascript console for logs and errors with command line.
Easily integrate a debug console into your web pages and keep an eye on logs, errors and warnings. Run functions directly from the command line.

With a minimal design, you can open and close the console at any time.Made in pure javascript, therefore it does not require the use of external libraries.

In the demonstration file (index.html) you can see how it works.

## How to use: 
- Create a "div" and assign an "id";
- Define a variable "cconsole" and associate it with the "div". ( var cconsole =  document.getElementById('myDiv');
- Run the page;
- Enjoy.
(Double click for open the console, for the first time. Auto-opening when logs and errors comes).

Put the "script.js" file on the end of the HTML page, after the definition of the variable. (see file index).
